# Daily Bible Verse

This program fetches a daily Bible verse from an API and displays it in a GUI. It uses the `requests` library to make an HTTP request to the API and the `tkinter` library to create the GUI.

To run the program, make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Then, you can run the `main.py` file to see the daily Bible verse displayed in the GUI. Click the "Get Daily Verse" button to fetch a new verse (change may not be obvious since the verse is the same for the day).
