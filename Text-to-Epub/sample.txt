The Great Novel
By John Smith

CHAPTER 1

It was a dark and stormy night. The rain pounded against the windows, creating a rhythmic melody that echoed through the empty hallways of the old mansion. David sat in his armchair, staring into the crackling fire, lost in thought.

The grandfather clock in the corner struck midnight, its deep chimes reverberating through the room. He turned the page of his book, but the words seemed to blur together. Something wasn't right.


CHAPTER 2

The next morning dawned bright and clear, with no evidence of the previous night's storm. David walked through the garden, coffee in hand, wondering if he had imagined the strange sounds he'd heard after midnight.

Birds chirped cheerfully in the trees overhead, and the scent of roses filled the air. It would be easy to forget the feelings of unease that had plagued him during the night.

But there, in the soft dirt beneath the oak tree, were footprints that didn't belong to him.


CHAPTER 3

"You must have been imagining things," Sarah said with a laugh when he called her later that day. "Or maybe it was just the wind playing tricks on you."

David wasn't convinced. "These footprints are real, Sarah. Someone was here last night."

"Well, then call the police," she suggested. "Or get a security system. That old house of yours could use an upgrade anyway."

He sighed, knowing she was right. But something told him this wasn't a simple case of trespassing. The footprints were too small, almost child-sized, and they stopped abruptly in the middle of the garden, as if whoever—or whatever—had made them had simply vanished into thin air.
