This Program seeks to implement the  [Black Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF9OU1_Bi4g) with the following changes:

+ The game is now a single player game: experimenter vs a computer challenger
+ your goal is to guess the solution is as few guesses as possible

if you make the window to small the game looks funky so try to avoid that.
